# vigenere cipher implementation using python
## The App has tkinter gui to encrypt and decrypt the input message and also to display encrypted and decrypted messages
## """
Vigen√®re cipher is one of the simplest that employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution (each letter is assigned
more than one substitute).
It was first described in 1553 but took an entire three centuries to break it in 1863.
Weakness: If someone finds key length then this can be broken
